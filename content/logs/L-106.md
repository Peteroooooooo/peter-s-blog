# The Singularity of Generative AI in Code

## The Shift

Six months ago, I started using Copilot full-time. Three months ago, I added GPT-4 to my workflow. The change has been... unsettling.

## What Changed

| Task | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Boilerplate code | 30 min | 2 min |
| Debug investigation | Hours | Minutes |
| Learning new API | Read docs | Ask AI |
| Architecture design | Still me | **Still me** |

The last row is the key insight.

## The Architect's Role

> We are becoming architects, not bricklayers. The AI lays bricks faster than any human could. But it doesn't know *where* to build.

What AI can't do:
- Understand business context
- Make taste-based design decisions
- Navigate organizational politics
- Question requirements

## My Prediction

Within 2 years, "writing code" will be a secondary skill for software engineers. **Systems thinking** and **communication** will be primary.

The engineers who thrive will be the ones who can:
1. Decompose ambiguous problems
2. Evaluate tradeoffs at scale
3. Communicate technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders

*The code writes itself. The question is what to write.*
