# System Migration: NTU Life

## Status Update

```
> MIGRATING base_of_operations...
> SOURCE: Hainan, China
> DESTINATION: Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
> STATUS: COMPLETE
```

## New Environment Variables

- **TIMEZONE**: UTC+8 (unchanged, conveniently)
- **LANGUAGE_PRIMARY**: English
- **HUMIDITY**: EXTREME
- **FOOD_QUALITY**: OUTSTANDING

## Initialization Log

Week 1: Orientation. Met fellow nodes in the network. Campus is massive — Google Maps is now a survival tool.

Week 2: Classes begin. Computer Science curriculum is rigorous but well-structured. The lab equipment is impressive.

Week 3: Found the good coffee spots. This is the real milestone.

## System Adaptations

- Switched to lightweight IDE setup (VS Code remote) for working on the go
- Adopted a standing desk workflow for dorm coding sessions
- Set up a local Raspberry Pi server for personal projects

> New neural links established. Academic protocols initialized. System nominal.
