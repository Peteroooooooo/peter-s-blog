# Designing for the Void: Dark Mode UX

## The #000000 Problem

Pure black on OLED screens causes **black smearing** — a ghosting effect when scrolling. This happens because OLED pixels physically turn off at `#000000`, and the re-activation latency creates visible trails.

## The Sweet Spot

After testing on 5 different OLED phones:

| Background | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `#000000` | Smearing on scroll |
| `#050505` | Minimal smearing, deep black feel |
| `#0a0a0a` | No smearing, slightly elevated |
| `#121212` | Material Design recommendation |
| `#1a1a1a` | Safe, but loses the "void" feeling |

I settled on **`#050505`** — the darkest value before smearing becomes noticeable.

## Typography on Dark

Light text on dark backgrounds requires **reduced font weight**. A `font-weight: 700` that looks perfect on white backgrounds feels **heavy and blinding** on black.

My rule: subtract 100-200 from your intended font weight for dark mode.

## Contrast Ratios

WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 contrast. On `#050505`:
- `#e0e0e0` → 16.5:1 ✓ (primary text)
- `#808080` → 5.6:1 ✓ (secondary text)
- `#404040` → 2.5:1 ✗ (too dim, use for decorative only)
